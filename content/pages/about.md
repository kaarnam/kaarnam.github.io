Karthika (pronounced kaar-tik-aa) Namboothiri is a data and graphics journalist based in New York City. She has previously worked at Reuters and The San Diego Union-Tribune, and is now a data journalist and part of the editorial board at Newsday. Namboothiri holds a Masters of Science degree in Data Journalism from Columbia University, with a specialization in Mapping.

Originally from Bangalore, India, Namboothiri’s work incorporates engaging storytelling techniques with complex data analysis. Her work at The San Diego Union-Tribune ranged from investigating wildfire mitigation activities in Southern California’s state forests to building print and web graphics for a video production on the rise in migrant deaths crossing the U.S.-Mexico border wall. The latter won second place in the California Journalism Awards in 2022 and was nominated for a regional Emmy.

At Newsday, Namboothiri covers a wide range of beats, including politics and the environment, occasionally writing a data column for the Opinion desk’s widely-read newsletter. She was part of the newsroom’s Dangerous Roads project in 2025, analyzing decades of vehicle crash data and building graphics, including an interactive map that became the top story of the year.

When she’s not building maps, Namboothiri is attempting to learn the piano and enjoys playing with her two cats, Tingmo and Unni.
