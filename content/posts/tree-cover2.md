The term “tree cover” refers to all kinds of trees - those in government parks and on other properties from federal to village jurisdictions as well as trees in private backyards and those along sidewalks and parking lots. A detailed analysis by nextLI of satellite data from the U.S. Geological Survey of every census tract on Long Island shows that tree cover is disproportionately spread across the region. Long Island’s most populous town, Hempstead, with 793,000 residents, has as little as 14% tree cover, according to the analysis. In contrast, more than half of Shelter Island, where around 3,000 people reside full time, is covered in trees.
