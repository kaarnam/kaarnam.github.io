      <description>&lt;p&gt;An interactive map showing every motor vehicle crash that took place on Long Island roads between 2022 and 2025, color-coded to indicate fatalities and serious injuries. The map was built as part of Newsday&amp;rsquo;s year-long Dangerous Roads series and data was obtained by Newsday from the New York State Dept. of Transportation. This map was the top story of the year in terms of user metrics and reader interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A detailed analysis of tree cover of the U.S. Geological Survey&amp;rsquo;s satellite data for every census tract on Long Island. Methodology involved use of zonal statistics and analysis shows that tree cover is disproportionately spread across Long Island. Story first published on my personal website before being published on Newsday. Graphics built using QGIS, Carto and Adobe Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
